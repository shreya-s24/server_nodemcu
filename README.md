Project is to take data from IR temp sensor(MLX 90614) and broadcast it to the app over the lab wifi. The microcontroller will be the NodeMCU board to make it easy to connect to the wifi
I hope to use the Firebase integration libraries but they are buggy and somehow not compatiable with the current version of the Arduino IDE. It seems to have been made for the older version.
The appdev part is something they didn't keep me updated on. From what i could see, we need to add a newsfeed, integrate calendar and deal with the notifications. Will happen soon enough.
Sadly, the project was delayed by a week due to ill health, but I'm fine now. Will finish by Sat, 7th July.
